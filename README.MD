AnalogKeys
==========

AnalogKeys is an arduino library that allows you to easily manage the keys on
an lcd shield that uses an analog input for the keys.

It allows you to calibrate the keys on the fly instead of having to preprogram
the keys. But it does allow you to still use preprogrammed values if you prefer.

# How to use

An example on how to use this library is included.
In order to see it open the `sketch` menu option when in the arduino ide.
Then go to `import library` and click on `add library`. Then in the folder
window navigate to where you have saved the `AnalogKeys` folder and select it
then press open.

You can then go to the `File` menu option and go to `examples`. Then go to
`AnalogKeys` and finally click on AnalogKeysExample. A new window will open in
which you can see the example sketch.
